Hi, my name is Maxence, a **French** software craftsman... or a web developer if you prefer. My main technologies are JavaScript and PHP.

## Why I want to move in Dublin?

First at all, I really want a **new challenge** in my life. So, I've decided to move in Dublin (from mid-September 2016) in order to:

* **Improve my English.** Every day, I read English blogs articles, write code in English... but I make a lot of mistakes. Over all, my spoken English isn't fluent (I don't speak with my French colleagues in English ;-) ).
* **Discover the Irish way of life** (including culture, way of working...). *World is big, life is short!*

This first point is **my priority**.
But don't leave this page now, I've some advantages :-)

## What can I do for you?

* **My work** is one of **my passions**. The best proof is this blog, my [Github](https://github.com/maxpou)... it doesn't pay my bills. If I write code outside of my work, **I'd also like writing code for you**.
* **API Design**: During my Software Architect degree, I've decided to write my dissertation on REST & SOA architectures. I've also wrote some posts (in French sorry).
* **Code quality enthusiast**: Most common developers write code for machines. Like M. Fowler, I prefer write code that humans can understand. To do it, I try to follow the *Clean Code* principles, the *Object Calisthenics* advices and to build *SOLID* code. I also use CI tools and Tests (BDD or TDD).
* **(strong) Technology watch**: I spend a lot of time on it: Twitter / meetup (local or not) / blogs / conferences (on Youtube).
* **Knowledge sharing**. As a kind of sponge, I absorb a lot of information and tend to share it to my colleagues (after filtering it of course!). For example, I'm used to give [talks, presentation and training](http://slides.maxpou.fr). I also try to [tweet](https://twitter.com/_maxpou) things that I think relevant and I blog sometimes.


I know, **my English level can be a barrier**... but trust me: I am **highly motivated to work on it**, to rob out this drawback!
