# A month in Lisbon as a Digital Nomad

## Accomodation

As usual for short term stay, the best option remains Airbnb. In Lisbon, you can get something decent from 19 to 50e/night.
If you stay longer, you should probably look some [Facebook groups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1544177542561065/?ref=bookmarks).

## Meeting people

Meetup.com
Facebook groups: [Lisbon Digital Nomads](https://www.facebook.com/groups/532696873566509/?ref=br_rs)

## Good places to work

I usually stay 3-4h / place.

* Linha D'Agua 4.5/5. Good view. Good coffee. Not very nice staff
* Choupana. 4/5. Very cheap. No plugs.
* Library. 4/5 caffe outside. Only problem: **low wifi**. Ability to stay lot of time. But lot of plugs and very quiet.
* Wish Coffee. 4/5. Slighly expensive (coffee = 2e when it's usually 0.7-1e). ‚ö†Ô∏è No laptop sticker on table. I came on the morning and it was ok for me to work there for few hours.
* Ler Devagar. 4.5/5. Lot of plugs. You can go upstairs, it's quiet. Problem: noisy (visitors) + allowed to smoke :( ability to stay lot of time.
* Evolution Hotel. 4.5/5. Good wifi. Electric plug. Nice sofa.

Honorable mentions:
* Brick Cafe. 3.5/5.


## Good application

(android but I hope it's also available on other OS)

* Meetup.com
* Foursquare.
* WifiMap. Few adds.
* WorkFrom. Give you place to work from.
* Sygic Travel. Reccomend you good place to see around. Nice to plan your day.

## Things to do

* Sintra.
* Belem. According to my AirBnb host, tower is not worthy. But if you get there, you must visit the Botanic Garden üå±
* Jardim da Funda√ß√£o Calouste Gulbenkian
* Jardim Bot√¢nico da Universidade de Lisboa
