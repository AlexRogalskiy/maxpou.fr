Earlier this year, I wrote a post where I mentioned how inefficient it is to build your own design
system in 2021. As expected, some people had a knee-jerk reaction.

I'm making app for +10y now and I'm still surprised to see how many companies have their own
definition of a god damn button.

Let's be honest. An application is not a piece of art. User don't go there just for to see the
beauty of what CSS can offer. People use the app because it fixes problems.

Bootstrap 2.0. Everywhere! And their app was: making tons of money, loved by many developers, ranked
in the top 100 most visited websites. Oh, and they also got acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion.

Why do we always end up building our own buttons? For our ego.

Yes, component libraries have limitations. But before building yours, ask yourself: "can I live with
it or not?".
